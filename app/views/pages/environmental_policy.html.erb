The Directors recognise that the quality of products and services and their impact on the environment are paramount in achieving total customer satisfaction and have put in place the following environmental initiatives:</p>

<ul class="list">
    <li><p>Implementation of ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System)</p></li>

    <li><p>Full reviews of all processes and materials that might affect the environment</p></li>

    <li><p>Consideration to the environment and the health and safety of employees in all areas of the organisation</p></li>

    <li><p>Making all employees aware that they are responsible for, and have an influence on, our impact on the environment</p></li>

    <li><p>Purchasing vehicles with fuel economy and emissions in mind</p></li>

    <li><p>Installation of wood burning furnaces with clean-air afterburners - disposing of waste board and extracted dust, reducing the amount of waste timber going to landfill and providing heating to the Mill and Spray shops. Heat generated by the furnace is also fed to our veneer press, reducing the energy required to maintain its operating temperature by around 50%</p></li>

    <li><p>Installation of noise reduction equipment on dust extraction plant</p></li>

    <li><p>Invertors on main dust extraction fans - linking fan speeds to extraction demands and reducing energy consumption</p></li>

    <li><p>All board, veneer &amp; timber manufacturers are FSC (Forestry Stewardship Council) Chain of Custody or equivalent certificated</p></li>

    <li><p>Undamaged packaging is returned and reused, including: cardboard, plastic corner protectors, crates, foam edge protectors and timber based protectors</p></li>
